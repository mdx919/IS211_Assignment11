i used pycharm with python 3 and sqlite with the help of flask_sqlalchemy

for running the app run python3 todoapp.py

note:
i finished both extra credt I and II
i didnt write seperate 'save' function since when you add the todo it saves automatically in todo.db using sqlite
'clear' button is working and clears all data
'delete' button is working and deletes individual todo based on their ID
